public class JoinMethodMain {

    /*
     Thread classâ€™s join method can be used to stop current execution
     of thread until thread it joins, completes its task.

     So basically , it waits for the thread on which join method
     is getting called, to die.

     ---- There are three variant of join method:

    1- public final void join() throws InterruptedException :
      Thread on which join method is getting called to die.

    2- public final void join(long millis) throws InterruptedException:
       This method when called on the thread, it waits for either of following:

       - Thread on which join method is getting called, to die.

       - Specified milliseconds


      3- public final void join(long millis, int nanos) throws InterruptedException:

       This method when called on the thread, it waits for either of following:
       - Thread on which join method is getting called, to die.
       - Specified milliseconds + nano seconds
